# Feature Selection Package
Python package for plug and play feature selection techniques, cross-validation and performance evalutation of machine learing models.
If you like the idea or you find usefull this repo in your job, please leave a ‚≠ê to support this personal project.

The documentation will grow with all the information about all the feature selection techniques.

1. Feature Selection techiniques (to be tested)
    * Variance Threshold;
    * Anova;
    * Mutual Information;
    * Feature Ranking (RFE);
    * Random Forest Feature Importance;
    * ReliefF;
    * Cross-correlation removal;
    * Cluster quality.

To accompany the feature section method this package has also:
* Cross Validation methods with performance metrics
    * k-fold;
    * Leave One Out (LOO);
    * Leave One Subject Out (LOSO).

* Performance Metrics for binary and multi-class tasks:
    * Confusion Matrix Plot (Binary and multi class tasks);
    * Precision (binary tasks);
    * Sensitivity (binary tasks);
    * Specificity (binary tasks);
    * F1 Score (binary tasks);
    * sklearn classification report (Binary and multi class tasks).
